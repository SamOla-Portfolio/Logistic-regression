# Logistic-regression
In this assignment, I will explore the correlates of internet access in Europe using the European Social Survey (ESS). three problems will be discuessed:

## Problem 1: Age and internet use:
In this problem, I hypothesized about the relationship between age and frequent internet use and explain the reasoning.
I will produce a single, well labeled plot that you feel best depicts the relationship between age and internet use present in the raw data.
I will fit a linear probability model that predicts internet use as a function of age. I will also fit a logistic regression model that predicts internet use as a function of age.
I will interpret the intercepts and age coefficients from both my linear probability model and your logistic regression model.

## Problem 2: Education and internet use:
I will theorize about the relationship between frequent internet use and education and develop appropriate hypotheses.then I will produce a contingency table showing the relationship between education and internet use and perform a chi-squared test. I will discuss the results in relation to my hypotheses.
I will estimate logistic regression and linear probability models using education to predict internet use.

## Problem 3: Determinants of internet use.
I will explain the relationship between age and internet use, or education and internet use variable(s) and age/education, and the relationship between the variable(s) and internet use, illustrating these relationships with appropriate tables or figures.
I will fit a logistic regression and linear probability models that predict internet use. then Interpret coefficients for the new covariates I introduced. Also reinterpret my age/education coefficients.
I will produce predicted probabilities for the effect of age/education on internet use, using results from the models I estimated before. and presenting these predictions as a well labeled and formatted figure or table.
